Briefly, this machine is best to install win, although it supports macOS somewhat, but it is not happy to use, battery drains quickly, optimizes performance and power is poor. If you use the experience or plug in the charger 24/24, you don't need to pay attention, the device is quite hot. In general, I will not leave macOS on this machine because it is better to use Windows. What about you guys, please test it with your device.
